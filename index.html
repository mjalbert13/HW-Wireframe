         <h2> Why you should bike</h2>
         <p>If you've never tried mountain biking, it's easy to watch professional mountain bikers race or compete and think  "it's just like riding a bike, right?" Well, not really.  Mountain biking takes a high degree of mental and physical stamina, whether you're competing or just trying to keep up with your mountain bike fanatic friend. It allows us to recognize our weaknesses and work on our skills to become better riders. Every mountain biker will crash, but mountain biking is a great way to push your comfort zone and gain confidence.  Ride with mountain bikers that are faster than you and more technically strong - instead of feeling defeated by their  skills,  power through to keep up with them and improve your technique. </p>
